# InDepthGenerativeAI

My hands-on experience with advanced deep learning and generative AI:
- Normalizing flows
- Energy based models
- Transformers
- Vision Transformers
- NLP: Text generation, summarization, translation, classification, contextualized word and sentence embeddings
- Autoencoders and variational autoencoders
- Autoregressive models (MLP, LSTM)
- Conditional GANs
- Transfer Learning
- CNNs including PixelCNN
- Model compression and handling few-label training sets.
- PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, Keras, and Tensorflow
